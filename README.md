*Emscripten GLUT/OpenGLES test with fix for browser resizing*

This is a modified version of Emscripten's test, [hello_world_gles.c](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/blob/incoming/tests/hello_world_gles.c), fixed to handle browser window resizing.

## Steps
Steps to reproduce issue:

    1. Build and run original version:

    emcc hello_world_gles_orig.c -s WASM=0 -o hello_world_gles.js
    emrun hello_world_gles_resizable.html

    2. Resize the browser window.  Note the chunky, unchanging resolution (300x300) regardless of browser window dimensions.

    3. Build and run fixed version:

    emcc hello_world_gles.c -s WASM=0 -o hello_world_gles.js
    emrun hello_world_gles_resizable.html

    4. Resize the browser window.  Note the full window resolution is now used, and the window aspect ratio is properly handled.

## Issue
The issue is that the glutReshapeFunc() callback is not being called when the browser window is resized.

## Fix
The fix (for now) is to detect when the HTML canvas has changed size in the glutDisplayFunc() callback, and explicitly call glutReshapeWindow() with the updated canvas size. This then invokes glutReshapeFunc() callback with the updated canvas size.  A better fix would be to get Emscripten's GLUT emulation to respond to browser window resize events under the hood.

The default html generated by Emscripten (-o hello_world_gles.html) does not show this issue because the canvas is not resizable.  To demonstrate the issue, an alternate HTML page is provided (hello_world_gles_resizable.html) which stretches the canvas to fill the entire browser window.
